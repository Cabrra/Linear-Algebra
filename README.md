Linear Algebra

![Desert Boxes](/Images/ArbitraryRotation.png)

+ DirectXMatrix and DirectXVector
	+ First project to dive deep using DirectX API and manipulate game objects. These two projects have tests to validate the results.
	
+ Arbitrary Axis Rotation simulation
	+ Render two boxes  by using  DirectX  D3DXMatrixRotationAxis  in real-time.  

+ Rotations simulation
	+ Render two boxes  by using  DirectX translation Matrix, D3DXMatrixTranslation, rotation Matrices (D3DXMatrixRotationX, D3DXMatrixRotationY, D3DXMatrixRotationZ) in real-time

+ Scaling simulation
	+ Render two boxes by using  DirectX  scaling Matrix, D3DXMatrixScaling in real-time.

+ Translations simulation
	+ Render two boxes  by using  DirectX translation Matrix, D3DXMatrixTranslation in real-time  

+ Lab Project
	+ This project was a mix to showcase all the learned things about DirectX Matrices and vectors. We had to complete all operations (implementing the needed logic) by the end of the course. I still use the learnings I got from this course to apply them on my role and game development operations. It also has a validation test cases.
